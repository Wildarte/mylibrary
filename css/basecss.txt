CSS Margins

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

Margin - individual sides

css has individual sides

css has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

all the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element

Tip: Negative values are allowed.

The auto value
You can set the margin property to auto to horizotally center the element whithin its container.

The element will then take uo the specified width, and remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining speace will be split equally between the left and right margins.

The inherit value

This example lets the left margin of the <p class="ex1"> element be inherited from the parent element (<div>):

Ex:

Use of the inherit value:

div{
    border: 1px solid red;
    margin-left: 100px;
}

CSS box model


the css Box Model

all html elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model"is used when talking about design and layout.

the css box model is essentially a box wraps around every html element. it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

content - the content of the bpx, where text and images appear
padding - clear an area around the content. the padding is transparent
border - a border that goes around the padding and content
margin - clears an area outside the border. the margin is transparent

the box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

width and height of an elment

in order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.

Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area.


CSS outline

an outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out".

CSS Outline width

The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline, and can have one of the following values:


thin (typically 1px)
medium (typically 3px
thick (typically 5px)
a specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc)

Example:

CSS outline offset

The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border od an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.

The followinf example specifies an outline 15px outside the border edge:

p{
margin: 30px;
border: 1px solid black;
outline: 1px solid red;
outline-offset: 15px;
}

The following example shows that the space between an element and its outline is transparent:

}

Next, add a color (red) to the shadow:


h1{
    text-shadow: 2px 2px red;
