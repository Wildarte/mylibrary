css has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

all the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element

Tip: Negative values are allowed.

The auto value
You can set the margin property to auto to horizotally center the element whithin its container.

The element will then take uo the specified width, and remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.

The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining speace will be split equally between the left and right margins.

The inherit value

This example lets the left margin of the <p class="ex1"> element be inherited from the parent element (<div>):

Ex:

Use of the inherit value:

div{
    border: 1px solid red;
    margin-left: 100px;
}

p.ex1{
    margin-left: inherit;
}
